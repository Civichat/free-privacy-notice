Open source privacy notice design patterns.

The Juro Privacy Notice is an open source project by https://juro.com and https://stefaniapassera.com/. 

In 2018, Juro and Stefania set out to build a privacy notice that people could actually read. This led to a 13,000% increase in views of the notice. The policy is now one of the most commonly-cited policies in the world and is frequently used as an example of clean information design. Check it out here: https://juro.com/#privacy-popup

Now, you can use the design patterns created for the Juro privacy notice on your own website privacy notice for free! You just need to include a link back to our site with this wording:

"This privacy notice was built based on an open source design from https://juro.com. Get these patterns free at github.com/rmabey/juro-privacy"

The privacy design patterns offered include:

- A 'privacy summary' modal
- The full layered privacy notice

Please note: Users of the privacy design patters expressly agree that they do not consider the patterns legal advice in any way. The wording included was created for Juro and you must use words in the notice that reflect your own privacy requirements. The Juro privacy notice uses icons from streamlineicons.com - these icons are not open source and can be used only for this project.
