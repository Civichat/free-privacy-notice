The Juro Privacy Notice is an open source project by https://juro.com and https://stefaniapassera.com/. 

A couple of years ago, we set out to build <b>a privacy notice that people could actually read</b>. This led to a 13,000% increase in views of the notice. The policy is now one of the most commonly-cited policies in the world and is frequently used as an example of clean information design. 

Check it out here: https://juro.com/#privacy-popup

Now, you can use the design patterns created for the Juro privacy notice on your own website privacy notice for free! 

<b>You just need to include a link back to our site with this wording: "This privacy notice was built based on an open source design from https://juro.com. Get these patterns free at github.com/juro-privacy</b>"

The privacy design patterns offered include:

- A 'privacy summary' modal
- The full layered privacy notice

See the technical readme file for developer instructions on how you can deploy these privacy design patterns in your own privacy notice.

Important: 

- Users of the privacy design patterns expressly agree that they <b>do not consider the patterns legal advice in any way</b>. 
- The wording of the legal text included was created for Juro and you <b>must customise</b> the design patterns and wording to your own privacy requirements. 
- The Juro privacy notice uses icons from streamlineicons.com - these icons are <b>not</b> open source and can be used <b>only for this project</b>.
