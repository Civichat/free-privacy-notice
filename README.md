The Juro Privacy Notice is an open source project by https://juro.com and https://stefaniapassera.com/. 

A couple of years ago, we set out to build <b>a privacy notice that people could actually read</b>. This led to a 13,000% increase in views of the notice. The policy is now one of the most commonly-cited policies in the world and is frequently used as an example of clean information design.

Now, you can use the design patterns created for the Juro privacy notice on your own website privacy notice for free! 

<b>You just need to include a link back to our site with this wording and links: "This privacy notice is based on an open-sourced design, powered by <a href="https://juro.com" target="_blank">Juro</a>&nbsp;- get your own <a href="https://info.juro.com/privacy-policy-template" target="_blank">free privacy policy template</a></b>"

The privacy design patterns offered include:

- A 'privacy summary' modal
- The full layered privacy notice

See the technical readme file for developer instructions on how you can deploy these privacy design patterns in your own privacy notice.

Important: 

- Users of the privacy design patterns expressly agree that they <b>do not consider the patterns legal advice in any way</b>. 
- The wording of the legal text included was created for Juro and you <b>must customise</b> the design patterns and wording to your own privacy requirements. 
- The Juro privacy notice uses icons from streamlineicons.com - these icons are <b>not</b> open source and can be used <b>only for this project</b>.
